# Music & Mental Health

*Explored the relationship between music genres and mental health conditions such as depression, insomnia, and OCD. Applied data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and Random Forest machine learning techniques to predict how different music genres affect mental health symptoms. This project was developed as part of AI4ALL Ignite, focusing on ethical AI and data-driven mental health insights.*


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

*Mental health is a critical global issue, and music therapy shows promise in improving emotional and cognitive well-being. However, little is known about how specific music genres impact different mental-health conditions. Understanding these effects can inform personalized therapeutic interventions, improving quality of life for those affected. Our project aims to uncover these connections using real-world survey data, while addressing biases inherent in the dataset.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

1. *Cleaned and analyzed a survey dataset linking music listening habits and mental health symptoms.*
2. *Identified genre preferences for depression, insomnia, and OCD among participants reporting moderate to severe symptoms.*
3. *Developed a Random Forest model to predict the effect of music genres on mental health conditions.*
4. *Highlighted potential biases in the dataset such as demographic skew and self-reporting limitations, suggesting avenues for future improvements.* 


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

*Utilized data preprocessing to handle missing values and convert categorical features to numerical formats. Applied exploratory data analysis to visualize genre preferences across mental health conditions. Built a Random Forest classifier to model the relationship between music genres and symptom improvement or worsening. Evaluated bias sources including selection, demographic, and label bias, and proposed mitigation strategies.*
